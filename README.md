## Introduction

**PanGBank** is a bioinformatics pipeline that uses PPanGGOLiN to generate pangenomes from a list of input genomes and taxonomy. It then prepares files for the PanGBank API.

1. Parse input genomes and taxonomy, grouping them by species.
2. Run PPanGGOLiN on the genomes of each species.
3. Compile the pangenome information into a single file.
4. Create a mash sketch for all input genomes to easily identify the most appropriate pangenome for an input genome.
5. Concatenate the amino acid sequences of representative families into a single file for rapid retrieval of pangenomes containing a protein of interest.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run labgem/pangbank \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
